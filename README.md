Galvos laser scanners, based on nema 17 stepper motors.

This laser scanner is designed to be used in a SLA 3d printer to replace the expensive Projector.

Steppers are driven by pololu A4988 stepper driver, with a 1/16 micro stepping, moving a light weight mirror doesn't need that much torque from the stepper motors, this is why i believe the micro stepping is efficient here.
 
The laser positioning is not accurate yet and needs more improvements. Very fast laser positioning will result in laser distortion, i guess this is due to the mirrors quality and the mechanical limitations of the stepper motors.

But in lower speeds this would do the trick for SLA printers as the resin needs to exposed to the laser beam for enough time.

Project is still in first phases and need more development, feel free to edit, improve and contribute back to this project.
